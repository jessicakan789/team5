All covid rules and restrictions have been lifted in Scotland, but the virus has not gone away.

Use 'Covid sense' to help protect yourself and others:
* Get your vaccine when offered to ensure you are fully protected
* Stay at home if youâ€™re unwell with symptoms or have a fever
* Open windows when socialising indoors
* Wear a face covering in indoor public places and on public transport
* Wash your hands to protect yourself
* Care for yourself and others to help slow down the spread of the virus and reduce pressure on our health services
