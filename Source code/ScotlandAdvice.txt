All covid rules and restrictions have been lifted in Scotland, but the virus has not gone away.

Use 'Covid sense' to help protect yourself and others:

get your vaccine when offered to ensure you are fully protected
stay at home if youâ€™re unwell with symptoms or have a fever
open windows when socialising indoors
wear a face covering in indoor public places and on public transport
wash your hands to protect yourself
Care for yourself and others to help slow down the spread of the virus and reduce pressure on our health services
